# Nonlinear Regression: Estimating Hand-to-Camera Distance

This project implements a quadratic nonlinear regression model to estimate the real-world distance between a hand and a camera based on the relative positions of hand landmarks in 2D images. The approach takes into account the nonlinear perspective effect observed in 2D image data when a hand moves closer to or farther from the camera.

## Background

Nonlinear regression is a statistical analysis method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable (y) and one or more independent variables (x), where the relationship is expressed using nonlinear functions. Common nonlinear functions include powers, logarithms, and exponentials. 

The general form of a nonlinear regression model can be represented as:

y = f(x, θ) + ε

Where:
- **f(x, θ):** Nonlinear function of the independent variable(s) x, parameterized by coefficients θ.
- **ε:** Random noise or error.

In this project, we employ a quadratic model of the form:

y = a * x^2 + b * x + c + ε

## Problem Statement

The project aims to estimate the real-world distance between a hand and a camera based on 2D image data. Specifically, we:
- Analyzed how the distance between hand landmarks varies with the hand’s position relative to the camera.
- Used the quadratic nonlinear regression model to predict the actual distance from the 2D pixel distance between specific hand landmarks.

### Key Landmarks and Methodology
1. **Landmarks Considered:**
   - Horizontal axis: Landmarks 5 and 17.
   - Vertical axis: Landmarks 9 and 0.

2. **Rationale:**
   - The distances between these landmarks remain stable during hand movements like grasping or spreading.
   - Adding vertical axis distances reduces errors caused by hand rotation.

3. **Pixel Distance Calculation:**
   - Using the Euclidean formula:
     d = √((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)

4. **Perspective Effect:**
   - Pixel distances increase as the hand moves closer to the camera and decrease as it moves away.

## Quadratic Model Fitting

The quadratic regression model was fitted using pixel distances as input (x) and real-world distances (y) as output:

y = a * x^2 + b * x + c

The coefficients (a, b, c) were determined using Python’s **numpy.polyfit** function, which minimizes the sum of squared errors between observed and predicted values.

## Data Collection

The collection of experimental data on real-world distances and pixel distances between hand landmarks played a critical role in building an accurate quadratic regression model. The data collection process was conducted systematically to ensure objectivity and reliability. The steps were as follows:

1. **Video Recording:**
   - Data was collected by recording videos under full lighting conditions to ensure sharp image quality and high accuracy in identifying hand landmarks.
   - Specific technical parameters:
     - Resolution: 1280 x 720 pixels
     - Frame rate: 30 fps

2. **Fixed Positions:**
   - The hand was placed at fixed distances from the camera, ranging from 22 cm to 117 cm, with increments of 5 cm.

3. **Pixel Distance Measurement:**
   - The chosen landmarks were points 5-17 and 0-9 on the hand, ensuring high measurement accuracy. Pixel distances were determined by analyzing images captured from the camera, forming relationships between real-world and pixel distances.

4. **Real-World Distance Measurement:**
   - For each recorded pixel distance, the real-world distance from the camera to the hand was precisely measured. Measurements were performed using accurate tools to minimize errors. These real-world distance values were stored and linked to their corresponding pixel distance values, forming a standardized dataset for modeling.

5. **Repetition:**
   - To ensure data reliability, the collection process was repeated multiple times to check data stability and detect any inconsistencies.

The final result of the data collection process was a dataset comprising pixel distances and corresponding real-world distances.

## Key Features

## Performance Metrics

- **CPU Usage:** 20.5%
- **Power Consumption:** High

The performance results indicate that the model operates stably under experimental conditions on a medium-configuration computer, suitable for practical applications requiring moderate hardware resources.
